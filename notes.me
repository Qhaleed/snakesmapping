    Search function (animals, taxonomy, authors, region, country)
        animals - when searching for an animal (eg. philippine eagle)
            it will get all specific result and will then index it from
            1 to n where n is the total number of result. Have a right/left button
            to traverse the list 
        taxonomy - instead of getting all the animals within that taxonomy, it will instead 
            filter it, meaning it will only show animals from the searched taxonomy

        author - animals contributed by the searched author.
        region - will reposition the zoom/coordinates to show the region.
        country - same logic with region but uses countries instead.
